- Shopping List Management: Allow users to mark items off the shopping list as they purchase them.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated Teal (#70CBC0) to evoke a sense of health and freshness.
- Background color: Eggshell White (#F0EAD6) for a clean, calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Metallic Gold (#B8860B) as a highlight for key interactive elements, call-to-action buttons, and important information displays, like macro totals.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, which provides a modern, clean look without being too sterile or techy. Use PT Sans for both headings and body text.
- Use minimalist icons in a 'linear' style to represent food categories and actions. Fill should be colored in the accent 'Metallic Gold' or primary 'Desaturated Teal' depending on visual priority. Use consistent line weights.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with generous use of white space to prevent visual clutter and improve readability. Panels/cards can have a slight shadow for a more 'premium' look. Important info (macro totals) are given high visual priority.
