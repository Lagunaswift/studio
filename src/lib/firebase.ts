// This file previously contained Firebase Firestore initialization.
// It has been removed as the project is migrating to Supabase for database operations.

// If you plan to use other Firebase services (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Storage (non-DB), etc.),
// you would initialize them here. For now, it's empty.

// Example:
// import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp, type FirebaseApp } from "firebase/app";
// const firebaseConfig = { /* your config */ };
// let app: FirebaseApp;
// if (!getApps().length) { app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig); } else { app = getApp(); }
// export { app };

console.log("Firebase Firestore integration has been removed. Using Supabase as the primary database.");

export {}; // Add an empty export to ensure it's treated as a module
