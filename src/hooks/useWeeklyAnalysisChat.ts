Aim to spread it across your meals - about 25-35g per main meal works well for most people.`;

‚Ä¢ Getting carbs around your workouts (30-60 minutes before/after)
‚Ä¢ Choosing nutrient-dense sources (oats, rice, potatoes, fruits)
‚Ä¢ Pairing them with protein for stable energy

This level should keep your energy steady without overshooting your calorie targets.`;

‚úÖ **Data-Driven**: Based on YOUR actual results, not generic formulas
‚úÖ **Conservative**: Small adjustments that won't shock your system  
‚úÖ **Reversible**: We can always adjust next week based on your response
‚úÖ **Track Record**: This method has consistently worked for users with similar profiles

The beauty of weekly check-ins is that we're constantly course-correcting based on real feedback from your body.`;

üîÑ **Metabolic Adaptation**: By adjusting based on your actual TDEE, we stay ahead of metabolic slowdown
üìä **Data Feedback Loop**: Weekly adjustments mean we catch plateaus before they happen
‚ö° **Energy Balance**: Keeping you energized prevents the metabolic crash that causes plateaus

Your body is smart and adapts to routines. By staying responsive to your data, we keep it guessing in a good way!`;

The new targets are designed to:
‚Ä¢ Provide adequate fuel for your daily activities
‚Ä¢ Prevent the energy crashes that come from too-aggressive deficits
‚Ä¢ Support quality sleep and recovery

If you experience any unusual fatigue with these new targets, we'll address it in next week's check-in.`;

Timeline approach:
üìÖ **Week 1**: Focus on hitting the new targets consistently
üìä **Week 2**: I'll analyze your response and make any needed adjustments  
üéØ **Ongoing**: Continuous optimization based on your progress

Remember, sustainable progress isn't always linear. Some weeks you'll see big changes, others will be about building the foundation for future success.`;

  return `That's an excellent question! ${coachingSummary}

These new targets represent the optimal next step based on your data. The approach is:

üéØ **Personalized**: Calculated from YOUR actual metabolic response
üìà **Progressive**: Designed to keep you moving toward your goals  
üî¨ **Scientific**: Based on proven principles of energy balance
‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced**: Sustainable for long-term success

The key is consistency with these new numbers. Trust the process, track your data, and we'll fine-tune again next week based on how your body responds.

Ready to put these into action?`;
